<!--l. 624--><p class="indent" >   A character object can be notated by writing <b>#\</b> followed by the character
itself. For example, <b>#\g</b> means the character object for a lowercase g. This works
well enough for printing characters. Non-printing characters have names, and can
be notated by writing <b>#\</b> and then the name; for example, <b>#\Space</b> (or
<b>#\SPACE</b> or <b>#\space</b> or <b>#\sPaCE</b>) means the space character. The syntax
for character names after <b>#\</b> is the same as that for symbols. However, only
character names that are known to the particular implementation may be
used.

<!--l. 636--><p class="noindent" >Common Lisp deﬁnes a standard character set (subtype <b>standard-char</b>) for
two purposes. Common Lisp programs that are <em>written</em> in the standard
character set can be read by any Common Lisp implementation; and
Common Lisp programs that <em>use</em> only standard characters as data objects are
most likely to be portable. The Common Lisp character set consists of a
space character <b>#\Space</b>, a newline character <b>#\Newline</b>, and the
following ninety-four non-blank printing characters or their equivalents:
<div class="lisp"><tt><div class="tabbing">
! &#x0022; # $ % &#x0026; &#x2019; ( ) * + , - . / 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 : ; &#x003C; = &#x003E; ?

<!--l. 650--><p class="indent" >   The Common Lisp standard character set is apparently equivalent to the
ninety-ﬁve standard ASCII printing characters plus a newline character.
Nevertheless, Common Lisp is designed to be relatively independent of the ASCII
character encoding. For example, the collating sequence is not speciﬁed except to
say that digits must be properly ordered, the uppercase letters must be properly
ordered, and the lowercase letters must be properly ordered (see <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x200-396229r229">char&#x003C;</a></b> for a
precise speciﬁcation). Other character encodings, particularly EBCDIC,
should be easily accommodated (with a suitable mapping of printing
characters).
<!--l. 661--><p class="indent" >   Of the ninety-four non-blank printing characters, the following are used in only
limited ways in the syntax of Common Lisp programs: <div class="lisp"><tt><div class="tabbing">
[  ]  {  }  ?  !  ̂  _  ~  $  %
   <br>
<!--l. 665--><p class="noindent" ></div>
</tt>
</div>
<!--l. 667--><p class="indent" >   The following characters are called <em>semi-standard</em>: <div class="lisp"><tt><div class="tabbing">
#\Backspace  #\Tab  #\Linefeed  #\Page  #\Return  #\Rubout
   <br>
<!--l. 670--><p class="noindent" ></div>
</tt>
</div>
<!--l. 671--><p class="indent" >   Not all implementations of Common Lisp need to support them; but those
implementations that use the standard ASCII character set should support them,
treating them as corresponding respectively to the ASCII characters BS (octal
code 010), HT (011), LF (012), FF (014), CR (015), and DEL (177). These
characters are not members of the subtype <b>standard-char</b> unless synonymous
with one of the standard characters speciﬁed above. For example, in a given
implementation it might be sensible for the implementor to deﬁne <b>#\Linefeed</b> or
<b>#\Return</b> to be synonymous with <b>#\Newline</b>, or <b>#\Tab</b> to be synonymous
with <b>#\Space</b>.

href="frontmatter.html#QQ2-11-29" id="x11-230002.2.2">Line Divisions</a></h4>
<!--l. 686--><p class="noindent" >The treatment of line divisions is one of the most diﬃcult issues in designing
portable software, simply because there is so little agreement among operating
systems. Some use a single character to delimit lines; the recommended
ASCII character for this purpose is the line feed character LF (also called
the new line character, NL), but some systems use the carriage return
character CR. Much more common is the two-character sequence CR
followed by LF. Frequently line divisions have no representation as a
character but are implicit in the structuring of a ﬁle into records, each record
containing a line of text. A deck of punched cards has this structure, for
example.
<!--l. 698--><p class="indent" >   Common Lisp provides an abstract interface by requiring that there be a single
character, <b>#\Newline</b>, that within the language serves as a line delimiter. (The
language C has a similar requirement.) An implementation of Common Lisp must
translate between this internal single-character representation and whatever
external representation(s) may be used.
____________________________________<div class="implementation">
<!--l. 706--><p class="noindent" ><b>Implementation note:</b> How the character called <b>#\Newline</b> is represented
internally is not speciﬁed here, but it is strongly suggested that the ASCII LF
character be used in Common Lisp implementations that use the ASCII character
encoding. The ASCII CR character is a workable, but in most cases inferior,
alternative.
</div>___________________________________________________________________________________________________________
<!--l. 715--><p class="indent" >     The requirement that a line division be represented as a single character has
certain consequences. A character string written in the middle of a program
in such a way as to span more than one line must contain exactly one
character to represent each line division. Consider this code fragment:
<div class="lisp"><tt><div class="tabbing">
(setq a-string &#x0022;This string
     <br>                                                                                    contains<br>
forty-two characters.&#x0022;)<br>
                                                                          

                                                                          
<!--l. 724--><p class="noindent" ></div>
</tt>
</div>
<!--l. 725--><p class="indent" >   Between <b>g</b> and <b>c</b> there must be exactly one character, <b>#\Newline</b>; a
two-character sequence, such as <b>#\Return</b> and then <b>#\Newline</b>, is not
acceptable, nor is the absence of a character. The same is true between <b>s</b> and
<b><a 
href="symbols.html#x200-396395r395">f</a></b>.
<!--l. 730--><p class="indent" >   When the character <b>#\Newline</b> is written to an output ﬁle, the Common
Lisp implementation must take the appropriate action to produce a line division.
This might involve writing out a record or translating <b>#\Newline</b> to a CR/LF
sequence.
_________________________________________________________________<div class="implementation">
<!--l. 736--><p class="noindent" ><b>Implementation note:</b> If an implementation uses the ASCII character encoding, uses
the CR/LF sequence externally to delimit lines, uses LF to represent <b>#\Newline</b>
internally, and supports <b>#\Return</b> as a data object corresponding to the ASCII
character CR, the question arises as to what action to take when the program writes out
<b>#\Return</b> followed by <b>#\Newline</b>. It should ﬁrst be noted that <b>#\Return</b> is not a
standard Common Lisp character, and the action to be taken when <b>#\Return</b> is
written out is therefore not deﬁned by the Common Lisp language. A plausible approach
is to buﬀer the <b>#\Return</b> character and suppress it if and only if the next
character is <b>#\Newline</b> (the net eﬀect is to generate a CR/LF sequence). Another
plausible approach is simply to ignore the diﬃculty and declare that writing
<b>#\Return</b> and then <b>#\Newline</b> results in the sequence CR/CR/LF in the
output.
