<!--l. 768--><p class="noindent" >Symbols are Lisp data objects that serve several purposes and have several
interesting characteristics. Every object of type <b>symbol</b> has a name, called its
<em>print name</em>. Given a symbol, one can obtain its name in the form of a
string. Conversely, given the name of a symbol as a string, one can obtain
the symbol itself. (More precisely, symbols are organized into <em>packages</em>,
and all the symbols in a package are uniquely identiﬁed by name. See
chapter <a 
href="xpack.html#x72-10900011">11<!--tex4ht:ref: XPACK --></a>.)
<!--l. 778--><p class="indent" >   Symbols have a component called the <em>property list</em>, or <em>plist</em>. By convention this
is always a list whose even-numbered components (calling the ﬁrst component
zero) are symbols, here functioning as property names, and whose odd-numbered
components are associated property values. Functions are provided for
manipulating this property list; in eﬀect, these allow a symbol to be treated as an
extensible record structure.
<!--l. 786--><p class="indent" >   Symbols are also used to represent certain kinds of variables in Lisp programs,
and there are functions for dealing with the values associated with symbols in this
role.
<!--l. 790--><p class="indent" >   A symbol can be notated simply by writing its name. If its name is not empty,
and if the name consists only of uppercase alphabetic, numeric, or certain
pseudo-alphabetic special characters (but not delimiter characters such as
parentheses or space), and if the name of the symbol cannot be mistaken for a
number, then the symbol can be notated by the sequence of characters in its
name. Any uppercase letters that appear in the (internal) name may be written in
either case in the external notation (more on this below). For example:
<div class="lisp"><tt><div class="tabbing">
FROBBOZ                 ;The symbol whose name is <b>FROBBOZ</b>
   <br>         frobboz                      ;Another way to notate the same symbol<br>
fRObBoz                    ;Yet another way to notate it<br>
unwind-protect            ;A symbol with a <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x188-380064r64">-</a></b> in its name<br>
+$                            ;The symbol named <b>+$</b><br>
                                                                          

                                                                          
1+                            ;The symbol named <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x188-380079r79">1+</a></b><br>
+1                            ;This is the integer 1, not a symbol<br>
pascal_style               ;This symbol has an underscore in its name<br>
b̂2-4*a*c                  ;This is a single symbol!<br>
                        ; It has several special characters in its name<br>
ﬁle.rel.43                    ;This symbol has periods in its name<br>
/usr/games/zork          ;This symbol has slashes in its name<br>
<!--l. 814--><p class="noindent" ></div>
</tt>
</div>
<!--l. 816--><p class="indent" >   In addition to letters and numbers, the following characters are normally
considered to be alphabetic for the purposes of notating symbols: <div class="lisp"><tt><div class="tabbing">
+  -  *  /  @  $  %  ̂  &#x0026;  _  =  &#x003C;  &#x003E;  ~  .
   <br>
<!--l. 821--><p class="noindent" ></div>
</tt>
</div>
<!--l. 822--><p class="indent" >   Some of these characters have conventional purposes for naming things; for
example, symbols that name special variables generally have names beginning and
ending with <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x188-380011r11">*</a></b>. The last character listed above, the period, is considered
alphabetic <em>provided</em> that a token does not consist entirely of periods.
A single period standing by itself is used in the notation of conses and
dotted lists; a token consisting of two or more periods is syntactically
illegal. (The period also serves as the decimal point in the notation of
numbers.)
<!--l. 832--><p class="indent" >   The following characters are also alphabetic by default but are explicitly
reserved to the user for deﬁnition as reader macro characters (see section <a 
href="clmse112.html#x139-18500022.1.3">22.1.3<!--tex4ht:ref: MACRO-CHARACTERS-SECTION --></a>)
or any other desired purpose and therefore should not be used routinely in names
of symbols: <div class="lisp"><tt><div class="tabbing">
?  !  [  ]  {  }
   <br>
                                                                          

                                                                          
<!--l. 838--><p class="noindent" ></div>
</tt>
</div>
<!--l. 840--><p class="indent" >   A symbol may have uppercase letters, lowercase letters, or both in its print
name. However, the Lisp reader normally converts lowercase letters to the
corresponding uppercase letters when reading symbols. The net eﬀect is that most
of the time case makes no diﬀerence when <em>notating</em> symbols. Case <em>does</em> make a
diﬀerence internally and when printing a symbol. Internally the symbols
that name all standard Common Lisp functions, variables, and keywords
have uppercase names; their names appear in lowercase in this book for
readability. Typing such names with lowercase letters works because the
function <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x188-380779r779">read</a></b> will convert lowercase letters to the equivalent uppercase
letters.
<b>
<!--l. 853--><p class="indent" >   <a 
href="symbols.html#x188-380790r790">readtable-case</a></b>, which controls whether <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x188-380779r779">read</a></b> will alter the case of letters
read as part of the name of a symbol.
<!--l. 856--><p class="indent" >   If a symbol cannot be simply notated by the characters of its name because
the (internal) name contains special characters or lowercase letters, then there are
two “escape” conventions for notating them. Writing a <b>\</b> character before any
character causes the character to be treated itself as an ordinary character for use
in a symbol name; in particular, it suppresses internal conversion of lowercase
letters to their uppercase equivalents. If any character in a notation is preceded by
<b>\</b>, then that notation can never be interpreted as a number. For example:
<div class="lisp"><tt><div class="tabbing">
\(                                   ;The symbol whose name is <b>(</b>
   <br>              \+1                                 ;The symbol whose name is <b>+1</b><br>
\1                                   ;Also the symbol whose name is <b>+1</b><br>
\frobboz                           ;The symbol whose name is <b>fROBBOZ</b><br>
3.14159265\s0                   ;The symbol whose name is <b>3.14159265s0</b><br>
3.14159265\S0                   ;A diﬀerent symbol, whose name is <b>3.14159265S0</b><br>
3.14159265s0                     ;A short-format ﬂoating-point approximation to <span class="math">π</span><br>
APL\\360                        ;The symbol whose name is <b>APL\360</b><br>
apl\\360                          ;Also the symbol whose name is <b>APL\360</b><br>
\(b̂2\)\ -\ 4*a*c              ;The name is <b>(B̂2) - 4*A*C</b>;<br>
                            ; it has parentheses and two spaces in it<br>

                            ; the letters are explicitly lowercase<br>
<!--l. 881--><p class="noindent" ></div>
</tt>
</div>
<!--l. 883--><p class="indent" >   It may be tedious to insert a <b>\</b> before <em>every</em> delimiter character in the name of
a symbol if there are many of them. An alternative convention is to surround the
name of a symbol with vertical bars; these cause every character between them to
be taken as part of the symbol&#x2019;s name, as if <b>\</b> had been written before each one,
excepting only <b>|</b> itself and <b>\</b>, which must nevertheless be preceded by <b>\</b>. For
example: <div class="lisp"><tt><div class="tabbing">
|&#x0022;|                            ;The same as writing <b>\&#x0022;</b>

|frobboz|                    ;The name is <b>frobboz</b>, not <b>FROBBOZ</b><br>
|APL\360|                  ;The name is <b>APL360</b>, because the <b>\</b> quotes the <b>3</b><br>
|APL\\360|                ;The name is <b>APL\360</b><br>
|apl\\360|                  ;The name is <b>apl\360</b><br>
|\|\||                         ;Same as <b>\|\|</b>: the name is <b>||</b><br>
|(B̂2) - 4*A*C|          ;The name is <b>(B̂2) - 4*A*C</b>;<br>
                        ; it has parentheses and two spaces in it<br>
