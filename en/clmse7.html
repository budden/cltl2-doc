<!--l. 993--><p class="noindent" >An <b>array</b> is an object with components arranged according to a Cartesian
coordinate system. In general, these components may be any Lisp data
objects.
<!--l. 997--><p class="indent" >   The number of dimensions of an array is called its <em>rank</em> (this terminology is
borrowed from APL); the rank is a non-negative integer. Likewise, each dimension
is itself a non-negative integer. The total number of elements in the array is the
product of all the dimensions.
<!--l. 1004--><p class="indent" >   An implementation of Common Lisp may impose a limit on the rank of an
array, but this limit may not be smaller than 7. Therefore, any Common Lisp
program may assume the use of arrays of rank 7 or less. (A program may
determine the actual limit on array ranks for a given implementation by
examining the constant <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x200-396118r118">array-rank-limit</a></b>.)
<!--l. 1010--><p class="indent" >   It is permissible for a dimension to be zero. In this case, the array has no
elements, and any attempt to access an element is in error. However, other
properties of the array, such as the dimensions themselves, may be used. If
the rank is zero, then there are no dimensions, and the product of the
dimensions is then by deﬁnition 1. A zero-rank array therefore has a single
element.
<!--l. 1018--><p class="indent" >   An array element is speciﬁed by a sequence of indices. The length of
the sequence must equal the rank of the array. Each index must be a
non-negative integer strictly less than the corresponding array dimension. Array
indexing is therefore zero-origin, not one-origin as in (the default case of)
Fortran.
<!--l. 1025--><p class="indent" >   As an example, suppose that the variable <b>foo</b> names a 3-by-5 array. Then the
ﬁrst index may be 0, 1, or 2, and the second index may be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. One
may refer to array elements using the function <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x200-396105r105">aref</a></b>; for example, <b>(aref foo 2
1)</b> refers to element (2, 1) of the array. Note that <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x200-396105r105">aref</a></b> takes a variable
number of arguments: an array, and as many indices as the array has
dimensions. A zero-rank array has no dimensions, and therefore <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x200-396105r105">aref</a></b> would
take such an array and no indices, and return the sole element of the
array.
                                                                          

                                                                          
<!--l. 1036--><p class="indent" >   In general, arrays can be multidimensional, can share their contents with other
array objects, and can have their size altered dynamically (either enlarging or
shrinking) after creation. A one-dimensional array may also have a <em>ﬁll
pointer</em>.
<!--l. 1041--><p class="indent" >   Multidimensional arrays store their components in row-major order; that is,
internally a multidimensional array is stored as a one-dimensional array, with the
multidimensional index sets ordered lexicographically, last index varying fastest.
This is important in two situations: (1) when arrays with diﬀerent dimensions
share their contents, and (2) when accessing very large arrays in a virtual-memory
implementation. (The ﬁrst situation is a matter of semantics; the second, a matter
of eﬃciency.)
<!--l. 1050--><p class="indent" >   An array that is not displaced to another array, has no ﬁll pointer, and is not
to have its size adjusted dynamically after creation is called a <em>simple</em> array. The
user may provide declarations that certain arrays will be simple. Some
implementations can handle simple arrays in an especially eﬃcient manner; for
example, simple arrays may have a more compact representation than non-simple
arrays.
<!--l. 1057--><p class="indent" >   If one or more of the <b>:adjustable</b>, <b>:ﬁll-pointer</b>, and <b>:displaced-to</b>
arguments is true when <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x200-396588r588">make-array</a></b> is called, then whether the resulting array is
simple is unspeciﬁed; but if all three arguments are false, then the resulting array
is guaranteed to be simple.

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.5.1   </span> <a 
href="frontmatter.html#QQ2-14-34" id="x14-280002.5.1">Vectors</a></h4>
<!--l. 1065--><p class="noindent" >One-dimensional arrays are called <em>vectors</em> in Common Lisp and constitute the
type <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x200-397004r1004">vector</a></b> (which is therefore a subtype of <b>array</b>). Vectors and lists are
collectively considered to be <em>sequences</em>. They diﬀer in that any component of a
one-dimensional array can be accessed in constant time, whereas the average
component access time for a list is linear in the length of the list; on the other
hand, adding a new element to the front of a list takes constant time, whereas
the same operation on an array takes time linear in the length of the
array.
<!--l. 1075--><p class="indent" >   A general vector (a one-dimensional array that can have any data object as an
element but that has no additional paraphernalia) can be notated by notating the
components in order, separated by whitespace and surrounded by <b>#(</b> and <b>)</b>. For
example: <div class="lisp"><tt><div class="tabbing">
                                                                          

                                                                          
#(a b c)                    ;A vector of length 3
   <br>                            #()                         ;An empty vector<br>
#(2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23 29 31 37 41 43 47)<br>
                            ;A vector containing the primes below 50<br>
<!--l. 1086--><p class="noindent" ></div>
</tt>
</div>
<!--l. 1087--><p class="indent" >   Note that when the function <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x200-396779r779">read</a></b> parses this syntax, it always constructs a
<em>simple</em> general vector.
_____________________________________________________<div class="rationale">
<!--l. 1091--><p class="noindent" ><b>Rationale:</b> Many people have suggested that brackets be used to notate vectors, as <b>[a b
c]</b> instead of <b>#(a b c)</b>. This notation would be shorter, perhaps more readable, and
certainly in accord with cultural conventions in other parts of computer science and
mathematics. However, to preserve the usefulness of the user-deﬁnable macro-character
feature of the function <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x200-396779r779">read</a></b>, it is necessary to leave some characters to the user for this
purpose. Experience in MacLisp has shown that users, especially implementors of
languages for use in artiﬁcial intelligence research, often want to deﬁne special kinds of
brackets. Therefore Common Lisp avoids using brackets and braces for any syntactic
purpose.
</div>___________________________________________________________________________________________________________
<!--l. 1107--><p class="indent" >     Implementations may provide certain specialized representations of arrays for
eﬃciency in the case where all the components are of the same specialized
(typically numeric) type. All implementations provide specialized arrays for the
cases when the components are characters (or rather, a special subset of the
characters); the one-dimensional instances of this specialization are called <em>strings</em>.
All implementations are also required to provide specialized arrays of bits, that is,
arrays of type <b>(array bit)</b>; the one-dimensional instances of this specialization
are called <em>bit-vectors</em>.

<!--l. 1126--><p class="noindent" >An implementation may support other string subtypes as well. All Common Lisp
functions that operate on strings treat all strings uniformly; note, however,
that it is an error to attempt to insert an extended character into a base
string.
<!--l. 1132--><p class="indent" >   The type <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x200-396910r910">string</a></b> is therefore a subtype of the type <b><a

<!--l. 1134--><p class="indent" >   A string can be written as the sequence of characters contained in the
string, preceded and followed by a <b>&#x0022;</b> (double quote) character. Any <b>&#x0022;</b> or <b>\</b>
character in the sequence must additionally have a <b>\</b> character before
it.

<!--l. 1146--><p class="indent" >   Notice that any vertical bar <b>|</b> in a string need not be preceded by a <b>\</b>.
Similarly, any double quote in the name of a symbol written using vertical-bar
notation need not be preceded by a <b>\</b>. The double-quote and vertical-bar
notations are similar but distinct: double quotes indicate a character string
containing the sequence of characters, whereas vertical bars indicate a symbol
whose name is the contained sequence of characters.
<!--l. 1155--><p class="indent" >   The characters contained by the double quotes, taken from left to right,
occupy locations within the string with increasing indices. The leftmost character
