<!--l. 25--><p class="noindent" >The compiler is a program that may make code run faster by translating
programs into an implementation-dependent form that can be executed more
eﬃciently by the computer. Most of the time you can write programs without
worrying about the compiler; compiling a ﬁle of code should produce an
equivalent but more eﬃcient program. When doing more esoteric things, you may
need to think carefully about what happens at “compile time” and what
happens at “load time.” Then the <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x188-380386r386">eval-when</a></b> construct becomes particularly
useful.
<!--l. 43--><p class="indent" >   Most declarations are not used by the Common Lisp interpreter; they may be
used to give advice to the compiler. The compiler may attempt to check your
advice and warn you if it is inconsistent.
<!--l. 51--><p class="indent" >   Unlike most other Lisp dialects, Common Lisp recognizes <b>special</b> declarations
in interpreted code as well as compiled code.

quoted constants in the corresponding source code. An object may be used as a
quoted constant processed by <b><a

guarantee that the resulting constant established by loading the compiled ﬁle is
“similar as a constant” to the original. Speciﬁc requirements are spelled out
below.
<!--l. 890--><p class="indent" >   Some types of objects, such as streams, are not supported in constants
processed by the ﬁle compiler. Such objects may not portably appear as constants
in code processed with <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x188-380261r261">compile-ﬁle</a></b>. Conforming implementations are required to
handle such objects either by having the compiler or loader reconstruct an
equivalent copy of the object in some implementation-speciﬁc manner or by
having the compiler signal an error.
<!--l. 898--><p class="indent" >   Of the types supported in constants, some are treated as aggregate objects.
For these types, being similar as constants is deﬁned recursively. We say that an
object of such a type has certain “basic attributes”; to be similar as a constant to
another object, the values of the corresponding attributes of the two objects must
also be similar as constants.
<!--l. 905--><p class="indent" >   A deﬁnition of this recursive form has problems with any circular or inﬁnitely
recursive object such as a list that is an element of itself. We use the
idea of depth-limited comparison and say that two objects are similar as
constants if they are similar at all ﬁnite levels. This idea is implicit in
the deﬁnitions below, and it applies in all the places where attributes
of two objects are required to be similar as constants. The question of
handling circular constants is the subject of a separate vote by X3J13 (see
below).

thought to be more dangerous than useful. Structures and objects could be
coalesced if a “similar as a constant” predicate were deﬁned for them; it would be a
generic function. However, at present there is no such predicate. Currently
