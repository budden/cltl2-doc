<!--l. 4044--><p class="noindent" >Common Lisp provides a facility for exiting from a complex process in a non-local,
dynamically scoped manner. There are two classes of special operators for this
purpose, called <em>catch</em> forms and <em>throw</em> forms, or simply <em>catches</em> and <em>throws</em>. A
catch form evaluates some subforms in such a way that, if a throw form is
executed during such evaluation, the evaluation is aborted at that point and the
catch form immediately returns a value speciﬁed by the throw. Unlike <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x200-396148r148">block</a></b> and
<b><a 
href="symbols.html#x200-396817r817">return</a></b> (section <a 
href="clmse41.html#x53-830007.7">7.7<!--tex4ht:ref: BLOCK-RETURN-SECTION --></a>), which allow for exiting a <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x200-396148r148">block</a></b> form from any
point lexically within the body of the <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x200-396148r148">block</a></b>, the catch/throw mechanism
works even if the throw form is not textually within the body of the catch
form. The throw need only occur within the extent (time span) of the
evaluation of the body of the catch. This is analogous to the distinction
between dynamically bound (special) variables and lexically bound (local)
variables.

The form <em>tag</em> is evaluated ﬁrst to produce an object that names the catch; it may
be any Lisp object. A catcher is then established with the object as the tag. The
<em>form</em>s are evaluated as an implicit <b><a

returned, except that if during the evaluation of the <em>form</em>s a throw should be
executed such that the tag of the throw matches (is <b><a

the evaluation of the <em>form</em>s is aborted and the results speciﬁed by the
throw are immediately returned from the <b><a

established by the <b><a

returned.
<!--l. 4080--><p class="indent" >   The tag is used to match throws with catches. <b>(catch &#x2019;foo <em>form</em>)</b> will
catch a <b>(throw &#x2019;foo <em>form</em>)</b> but not a <b>(throw &#x2019;bar <em>form</em>)</b>. It is an

the target tag belongs) which is being executed at the time the <b><a

performed.
<!--l. 4200--><p class="indent" >   The extent of an exit is dynamic; it is not indeﬁnite. The extent of an exit
begins when the corresponding form (<b><a

entered. When the extent of an exit has ended, it is no longer legal to return from
it.
<!--l. 4205--><p class="indent" >   Note that the extent of an exit is not the same thing as the scope or
extent of the designator by which the exit is identiﬁed. For example, a
<b><a 
href="symbols.html#x200-396148r148">block</a></b> name has lexical scope but the extent of its exit is dynamic. The
extent of a <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x200-396193r193">catch</a></b> tag could diﬀer from the extent of the exit associated
with the <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x200-396193r193">catch</a></b> (which is exactly what is at issue here). The diﬀerence
matters when there are transfers of control from the cleanup clauses of an

      </li>
      <li class="itemize">The extent of the exit being invoked ends.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Control is ﬁnally passed to the target.</li></ul>
<!--l. 4226--><p class="noindent" >The ﬁrst edition left the order of these events in some doubt. The implementation
note for <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x200-396963r963">throw</a></b> hinted that the ﬁrst two processes are interwoven, but it was
unclear whether it is permissible for an implementation to abandon all
intervening exits before processing any intervening <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x200-396990r990">unwind-protect</a></b> cleanup
clauses.
<!--l. 4233--><p class="indent" >   The clariﬁcation adopted by X3J13 is as follows. Intervening exits are
abandoned as soon as the transfer of control is initiated; in the case of a <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x200-396963r963">throw</a></b>,
this occurs at the beginning of the “second pass” mentioned in the implementation
note. It is an error to attempt a transfer of control to an exit whose dynamic
extent has ended.
<!--l. 4240--><p class="indent" >   Next the evaluation of <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x200-396990r990">unwind-protect</a></b> cleanup clauses and the undoing of
dynamic bindings and <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x200-396193r193">catch</a></b> tags are performed together, in the order
corresponding to the reverse of the order in which they were established. The
eﬀect of this is that the cleanup clauses of an <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x200-396990r990">unwind-protect</a></b> will see the same
dynamic bindings of variables and <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x200-396193r193">catch</a></b> tags as were visible when the
<b><a 
href="symbols.html#x200-396990r990">unwind-protect</a></b> was entered. (However, some of those <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x200-396193r193">catch</a></b> tags may not be
useable because they correspond to abandoned exit points.)
<!--l. 4250--><p class="indent" >   Finally control is transferred to the originally invoked exit and simultaneously
that exit is abandoned.
<!--l. 4253--><p class="indent" >   The eﬀect of this speciﬁcation is that once a program has attempted to
transfer control to a particular exit, an <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x200-396990r990">unwind-protect</a></b> cleanup form
cannot step in and decide to transfer control to a more recent (nested) exit,
blithely forgetting the original exit request. However, a cleanup form may
restate the request to transfer to the same exit that started the cleanup
process.

an oar in the water with low force, but if an oar gets stuck, the caller will catch a

<!--l. 4289--><p class="indent" >   Suppose that the oar gets stuck, causing <b>gently</b> to call <b><a

<b>crab</b>. The program is then committed to exiting from the outer <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x200-396193r193">catch</a></b> (the
one with the tag <b>crab</b>). As control breaks out of the <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x200-396990r990">unwind-protect</a></b>
form, the <b>winded</b> test is executed. Suppose it is true; then another call
to <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x200-396963r963">throw</a></b> occurs, this time with the tag <b>breath</b>. The inner <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x200-396193r193">catch</a></b> (the
one with the tag <b>breath</b>) has been abandoned as a result of the ﬁrst
<b><a 
href="symbols.html#x200-396963r963">throw</a></b> operation (still in progress). The clariﬁcation voted by X3J13
speciﬁes that the program is in error for attempting to transfer control to
an abandoned exit point. To put it in terms of the example: once you
have begun to catch a crab, you cannot rely on being able to catch your
breath.
<!--l. 4302--><p class="indent" >   Implementations may support longer extents for exits than is required by
this speciﬁcation, but portable programs may not rely on such extended
extents.
<!--l. 4306--><p class="indent" >   (This speciﬁcation is somewhat controversial. An alternative proposal was
that the abandoning of exits should be lumped in with the evaluation of
<b><a 
href="symbols.html#x200-396990r990">unwind-protect</a></b> cleanup clauses and the undoing of dynamic bindings and <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x200-396193r193">catch</a></b>
tags, performing all in reverse order of establishment. X3J13 agreed that this
                                                                          

                                                                          
approach is theoretically cleaner and more elegant but also more stringent and of
little additional practical use. There was some concern that a more stringent
speciﬁcation might be a great added burden to some implementors and would
achieve only a small gain for users.)

<!--l. 4321--><p class="indent" >   The <b><a

href="symbols.html#x200-396193r193">catch</a></b> construct.
The <em>tag</em> is evaluated ﬁrst to produce an object called the throw tag; then the
<em>result</em> form is evaluated, and its results are saved (if the <em>result</em> form produces
multiple values, then <em>all</em> the values are saved). The most recent outstanding catch
whose tag matches the throw tag is exited; the saved results are returned as the
value(s) of the catch. A <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x200-396193r193">catch</a></b> matches only if the catch tag is <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x200-396378r378">eq</a></b> to the throw
tag.
<!--l. 4331--><p class="indent" >   In the process, dynamic variable bindings are undone back to the point of the
catch, and any intervening <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x200-396990r990">unwind-protect</a></b> cleanup code is executed. The <em>result</em>
form is evaluated before the unwinding process commences, and whatever results
it produces are returned from the catch.
<!--l. 4337--><p class="indent" >   If there is no outstanding catcher whose tag matches the throw tag, no
unwinding of the stack is performed, and an error is signalled. When the error is
signalled, the outstanding catchers and the dynamic variable bindings are those in
force at the point of the throw.

<!--l. 4343--><p class="noindent" ><b>Implementation note:</b> These requirements imply that throwing should typically
make two passes over the control stack. In the ﬁrst pass it simply searches for
a matching catch. In this search every <b><a
