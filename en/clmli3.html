<!--l. 227--><p class="indent" >   First and foremost, I must thank the many people in the Lisp community who
have worked so hard to specify, implement, and use Common Lisp. Some of these
have volunteered many hours of eﬀort as members of ANSI committee X3J13.
Others have made presentations or proposals to X3J13, and yet others have sent
suggestions and corrections to the ﬁrst edition directly to me. This book builds on
their eﬀorts as well as mine.
<!--l. 237--><p class="indent" >   An early draft of this book was made available to all members of X3J13 for
their criticism. I have also worked with the many public documents that
have been written during the course of the committee&#x2019;s work (which is
not over yet). It is my hope that this book is an accurate reﬂection of
the committee&#x2019;s actions as of October 1989. Nevertheless, any errors or
inconsistencies are my responsibility. The fact that I have made a draft available
to certain persons, received feedback from them, or thanked them in these
acknowledgments does not necessarily imply that any one of them or any of the
institutions with which they are aﬃliated endorse this book or anything of its
contents.
<!--l. 250--><p class="indent" >   Digital Press and I gave permission to X3J13 to use any or all parts of the ﬁrst
edition in the production of an ANSI Common Lisp standard. Conversely,
in writing this book I have worked with publicly available documents
produced by X3J13 in the course of its work, and in some cases as a courtesy
have obtained the consent of the authors of those documents to quote
them extensively. This common ancestry will result in similarities between
this book and the emerging ANSI Common Lisp standard (that is the
purpose, after all). Nevertheless, this second edition has no oﬃcial connection
whatsoever with X3J13 or ANSI, nor is it endorsed by either of those
institutions.

<!--l. 295--><p class="indent" >   I must express particular gratitude and appreciation to a number of people for
their exceptional eﬀorts:
<!--l. 298--><p class="indent" >   Larry Masinter, chairman of the X3J13 Cleanup Subcommittee, developed the
standard format for documenting all proposals to be voted upon. The result has
been an outstanding technical and historical record of all the actions taken by
X3J13 to rectify and improve Common Lisp.
<!--l. 304--><p class="indent" >   Sandra Loosemore, chairwoman of the X3J13 Compiler Subcommittee,
                                                                          

                                                                          
produced many proposals for clarifying the semantics of the compilation process.
She has been a diligent stickler for detail and has helped to clarify many parts of
Common Lisp left vague in the ﬁrst edition.
<!--l. 309--><p class="indent" >   Jon L White, chairman of the X3J13 Iteration Subcommittee, supervised the
consideration of several controversial proposals, one of which (<b><a 
href="symbols.html#x200-396577r577">loop</a></b>) was
eventually adopted by X3J13.
<!--l. 313--><p class="indent" >   Thom Linden, chairman of the X3J13 Character Subcommittee, led a team in
grappling with the diﬃcult problem of accommodating various character sets in
Common Lisp. One result is that Common Lisp will be more attractive for
international use.
<!--l. 318--><p class="indent" >   Kent Pitman, chairman of the X3J13 Error Handling Subcommittee, plugged
the biggest outstanding hole in Common Lisp as described by the ﬁrst
edition.
<!--l. 322--><p class="indent" >   Kathy Chapman, chairwoman of the X3J13 Drafting Subcommittee, and
principal author of the draft standard, has not only written a great deal of text
but also insisted on coherent and consistent terminology and pushed the rest of
the committee forward when necessary.
<!--l. 327--><p class="indent" >   Robert Mathis, chairman of X3J13, has kept administrative matters ﬂowing
smoothly during technical controversies.
<!--l. 330--><p class="indent" >   Mary Van Deusen, secretary of X3J13, kept excellent minutes that were
a tremendous aid to me in tracing the history of a number of complex
discussions.
<!--l. 334--><p class="indent" >   Jan Zubkoﬀ, X3J13 meeting and mailing organizer, knows what&#x2019;s going on, as
always. She is a master of organization and of physical arrangements. Moreover,
she once again pulled me out of the ﬁre at the last minute.
<!--l. 339--><p class="indent" >   Dick Gabriel, international representative for X3J13, has kept information
ﬂowing smoothly between Europe, Japan, and the United States. He provided a
great deal of the energy and drive for the completion of the Common Lisp Object
System speciﬁcation. He has also provided me with a great deal of valuable advice
and has been on call for last-minute consultation at all hours during the ﬁnal
stages of preparation for this book.
<!--l. 348--><p class="indent" >   David Moon has consistently been a source of reason, expert knowledge, and
careful scrutiny. He has read the ﬁrst edition and the X3J13 proposals perhaps
more carefully than anyone else.
<!--l. 353--><p class="indent" >   David Moon, Jon L White, Gregor Kiczales, Robert Mathis, Mary Boelk
provided extensive feedback on an early draft of this book. I thank them as
well as the many others who commented in one way or another on the
draft.
                                                                          

                                                                          
<!--l. 358--><p class="indent" >   I wish to thank the authors of large proposals to X3J13 that have made
material available for more or less wholesale inclusion in this book as distinct
chapters. This material was produced primarily for the use of X3J13 in its work.
It has been included here on a non-exclusive basis with the consent of the
authors.
<!--l. 365--><p class="indent" >   The author of the chapter on <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x200-396577r577">loop</a></b> (Jon L White) notes that the chapter is
based on documentation written at Lucid, Inc., by Molly M. Miller, Sonia Orin
Lyris, and Kris Dinkel. Glenn Burke, Scott Fahlman, Colin Meldrum, David
Moon, Cris Perdue, and Dick Waters contributed to the design of the <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x200-396577r577">loop</a></b>
macro.
<!--l. 373--><p class="indent" >   The authors of the Common Lisp Object System speciﬁcation (Daniel
G. Bobrow, Linda G. DeMichiel, Richard P. Gabriel, Sonya E. Keene, Gregor
Kiczales, and David A. Moon) wish to thank Patrick Dussud, Kenneth Kahn, Jim
Kempf, Larry Masinter, Mark Steﬁk, Daniel L. Weinreb, and Jon L White for
their contributions.
<!--l. 382--><p class="indent" >   The author of the chapter on Conditions (Kent M. Pitman) notes that there is
a paper <span class="cite">[<a 
href="bib.html#XEXCEPTIONAL-SITUATIONS">38</a>]</span> containing background information about the design of the condition
system, which is based on the condition system of the Symbolics Lisp Machines
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="bib.html#XSIGNALLING-CONDITIONS">49</a>]</span>. The members of the X3J13 Error Handling Subcommittee were Andy Daniels
and Kent Pitman. Richard Mlynarik and David A. Moon made major design
contributions. Useful comments, questions, suggestions, and criticisms were
provided by Paul Anagnostopoulos, Alan Bawden, William Chiles, Pavel
Curtis, Mary Fontana, Dick Gabriel, Dick King, Susan Lander, David D.
Loeﬄer, Ken Olum, David C. Plummer, Alan Snyder, Eric Weaver, and
Daniel L. Weinreb. The Condition System was designed speciﬁcally to
accommodate the needs of Common Lisp. The design is, however, most
directly based on the “New Error System” (NES) developed at Symbolics
by David L. Andre, Bernard S. Greenberg, Mike McMahon, David A.
Moon, and Daniel L. Weinreb. The NES was in turn based on experiences
with the original Lisp Machine error system (developed at MIT), which
was found to be inadequate for the needs of the modern Lisp Machine
environments. Many aspects of the NES were inspired by the (PL/I) condition
system used by the Honeywell Multics operating system. Henry Lieberman
provided conceptual guidance and encouragement in the design of the
NES. A reimplementation of the NES for non-Symbolics Lisp Machine
dialects (MIT, LMI, and TI) was done at MIT by Richard M. Stallman.
During the process of that reimplementation, some conceptual changes were
made which have signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced the Common Lisp Condition
                                                                          

                                                                          
System.
<!--l. 428--><p class="indent" >   As for the smaller but no less important proposals, Larry Masinter deserves
recognition as an author of over half of them. He has worked indefatigably to
write up proposals and to polish drafts by other authors. Kent Pitman, David
Moon, and Sandra Loosemore have also been notably proliﬁc, as well as Jon L
White, Dan Pierson, Walter van Roggen, Skona Brittain, Scott Fahlman, and
myself. Other authors of proposals include David Andre, John Aspinall, Kim
Barrett, Eric Benson, Daniel Bobrow, Bob Cassels, Kathy Chapman, William
Clinger, Pavel Curtis, Doug Cutting, Jeﬀ Dalton, Linda DiMichiel, Richard
Gabriel, Steven Haﬂich, Sonya Keene, James Kempf, Gregor Kiczales, Dieter
Kolb, Barry Margolin, Chris McConnell, Jeﬀ Peck, Jan Pedersen, Crispin Perdue,
Jonathan Rees, Don Sakahara, David Touretzky, Richard Waters, and Gail
Zacharias.
<!--l. 465--><p class="indent" >   I am grateful to Donald E. Knuth and his colleagues for producing the
<span class="TEX">T<span 
class="E">E</span>X</span> text formatting system <span class="cite">[<a 
href="bib.html#XKNUTH-TEXBOOK">28</a>]</span>, which was used to produce and typeset the
manuscript. Knuth did an especially good job of publishing the program for
<span class="TEX">T<span 
class="E">E</span>X</span> <span class="cite">[<a 
href="bib.html#XKNUTH-TEX-PROGRAM">29</a>]</span>; I had to consult the code about eight times while debugging
particularly complicated macros. Thanks to the extensive indexing and
cross-references, in each case it took me less than ﬁve minutes to ﬁnd the relevant
fragment of that 500-page program.
<!--l. 476--><p class="indent" >   I also owe a debt to Leslie Lamport, author of the <span class="LATEX">L<span class="A">A</span><span class="TEX">T<span 
class="E">E</span>X</span></span> macro
package <span class="cite">[<a 
href="bib.html#XLAMPORT-LATEX">30</a>]</span> for <span class="TEX">T<span 
class="E">E</span>X</span>, within which I implemented the document style for this
book.
<!--l. 481--><p class="indent" >   Blue Sky Research sells and supports Textures, an implementation of <span class="TEX">T<span 
class="E">E</span>X</span> for
Apple Macintosh computers; Gayla Groom and Barry Smith of Blue Sky Research
provided excellent technical support when I needed it. Other software tools that
were invaluable in preparing this book were QuicKeys (sold by CE Software, Inc.),
which provides keyboard macros; G¯ofer (sold by Microlytics, Inc.), which performs
rapid text searches in multiple ﬁles; Symantec Utilities for Macintosh (sold by
Symantec Corporation), which saved me from more than one disk crash; and
the PostScript language and compatible fonts (sold by Adobe Systems
Incorporated).
<!--l. 493--><p class="indent" >   Some of this software (such as <span class="LATEX">L<span class="A">A</span><span class="TEX">T<span 
class="E">E</span>X</span></span>) I obtained for free and some I bought,
but all have proved to be useful tools of excellent quality. I am grateful to these
developers for creating them.
<!--l. 497--><p class="indent" >   Electronic mail has been indispensible to the writing of this book, as well to as
the work of X3J13. (It is a humbling experience to publish a book and then
for the next ﬁve years to receive at least one electronic mail message a
                                                                          

                                                                          
week, if not twenty, pointing out some mistake or defect.) Kudos to those
develop and maintain the Internet, which arose from the Arpanet and other
networks.
<!--l. 506--><p class="indent" >   Chase Duﬀy, George Horesta, and Will Buddenhagen of Digital Press have
given me much encouragement and support. David Ford designed the book and
provided speciﬁcations that I could code into <span class="TEX">T<span 
class="E">E</span>X</span>. Alice Cheyer and Kate Schmit
edited the copy for style and puzzled over the more obscure jokes with great
patience. Marilyn Rowland created the index; Tim Evans and I did some
polishing. Laura Fillmore and her colleagues at Editorial, Inc., have tirelessly and
meticulously checked one draft after another and has kept the paperwork ﬂowing
smoothly during the last hectic weeks of proofreading, page makeup, and
typesetting.
<!--l. 517--><p class="indent" >   Thinking Machines Corporation has supported all my work with X3J13. I
thank all my colleagues there for their encouragement and help.
<!--l. 520--><p class="indent" >   Others who provided indispensible encouragement and support include Guy
and Nalora Steele; David Steele; Cordon and Ruth Kerns; David, Patricia, Tavis,
Jacob, Nicholas, and Daniel Auwerda; Donald and Denise Kerns; and David,
Joyce, and Christine Kerns.
<!--l. 525--><p class="indent" >   Most of the writing of this book took place between 10 P.M. and 3 A.M. (I&#x2019;m
not as young as I used to be). I am grateful to Barbara, Julia, Peter, and
Matthew for putting up with it, and for their love.
