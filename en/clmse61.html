<!--l. 443--><p class="noindent" >A fundamental invariant of the package system is that within one package any
particular name can refer to at most one symbol. A <em>name conﬂict</em> is said to occur
when there is more than one candidate symbol and it is not obvious which one to
choose. If the system does not always choose the same way, the read-read
consistency rule would be violated. For example, some programs or data might
have been read in under a certain mapping of the name to a symbol. If
the mapping changes to a diﬀerent symbol, and subsequently additional
programs or data are read, then the two programs will not access the
same symbol even though they use the same name. Even if the system
did always choose the same way, a name conﬂict is likely to result in a
mapping from names to symbols diﬀerent from what was expected by
the user, causing programs to execute incorrectly. Therefore, any time
a name conﬂict is about to occur, an error is signaled. The user may
continue from the error and tell the package system how to resolve the
conﬂict.
<!--l. 460--><p class="indent" >   It may be that the same symbol is accessible to a package through more than
one path. For example, the symbol might be an external symbol of more than one
used package, or the symbol might be directly present in a package and also
inherited from another package. In such cases there is no name conﬂict. The same
identical symbol cannot conﬂict with itself. Name conﬂicts occur only between
distinct symbols with the same name.
<!--l. 470--><p class="indent" >   The creator of a package can tell the system in advance how to resolve a
name conﬂict through the use of <em>shadowing</em>. Every package has a list
of shadowing symbols. A shadowing symbol takes precedence over any
other symbol of the same name that would otherwise be accessible to
the package. A name conﬂict involving a shadowing symbol is always
resolved in favor of the shadowing symbol, without signaling an error
(except for one instance involving <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x188-380492r492">import</a></b> described below). The functions
<b><a 
href="symbols.html#x188-380848r848">shadow</a></b> and <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x188-380849r849">shadowing-import</a></b> may be used to declare shadowing
symbols.
<!--l. 480--><p class="indent" >   Name conﬂicts are detected when they become possible, that is, when the
package structure is altered. There is no need to check for name conﬂicts during
                                                                          

                                                                          
every name lookup.
<!--l. 484--><p class="indent" >   The functions <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x188-380997r997">use-package</a></b>, <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x188-380492r492">import</a></b>, and <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x188-380391r391">export</a></b> check for name conﬂicts.
<b><a 
href="symbols.html#x188-380997r997">use-package</a></b> makes the external symbols of the package being used accessible to
the using package; each of these symbols is checked for name conﬂicts with the
symbols already accessible. <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x188-380492r492">import</a></b> adds a single symbol to the internals of a
package, checking for a name conﬂict with an existing symbol either present in the
package or accessible to it. <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x188-380492r492">import</a></b> signals a name conﬂict error even if
the conﬂict is with a shadowing symbol, the rationale being that the
user has given two explicit and inconsistent directives. <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x188-380391r391">export</a></b> makes a
single symbol accessible to all the packages that use the package from
which the symbol is exported. All of these packages are checked for name
conﬂicts: <b>(export <em>s</em> <em>p</em>)</b> does <b>(ﬁnd-symbol (symbol-name <em>s</em>) <em>q</em>)</b> for
each package <em>q</em> in <b>(package-used-by-list <em>p</em>)</b>. Note that in the usual
case of an <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x188-380391r391">export</a></b> during the initial deﬁnition of a package, the result of
<b><a 
href="symbols.html#x188-380711r711">package-used-by-list</a></b> will be <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x188-380670r670">nil</a></b> and the name-conﬂict checking will take
negligible time.
<!--l. 504--><p class="indent" >   The function <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x188-380504r504">intern</a></b>, which is the one used most frequently by the Lisp reader
for looking up names of symbols, does not need to do any name-conﬂict checking,
because it never creates a new symbol if there is already an accessible symbol with
the name given.
<b>
<!--l. 510--><p class="indent" >   <a 
href="symbols.html#x188-380848r848">shadow</a></b> and <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x188-380849r849">shadowing-import</a></b> never signal a name-conﬂict error because
the user, by calling these functions, has speciﬁed how any possible conﬂict is to be
resolved. <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x188-380848r848">shadow</a></b> does name-conﬂict checking to the extent that it checks
whether a distinct existing symbol with the speciﬁed name is accessible and, if so,
whether it is directly present in the package or inherited. In the latter case, a new
symbol is created to shadow it. <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x188-380849r849">shadowing-import</a></b> does name-conﬂict
checking to the extent that it checks whether a distinct existing symbol with
the same name is accessible; if so, it is shadowed by the new symbol,
which implies that it must be uninterned if it was directly present in the
package.
<b>
<!--l. 522--><p class="indent" >   <a 
href="symbols.html#x188-380988r988">unuse-package</a></b>, <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x188-380981r981">unexport</a></b>, and <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x188-380982r982">unintern</a></b> (when the symbol being
uninterned is not a shadowing symbol) do not need to do any name-conﬂict
checking because they only remove symbols from a package; they do not make any
new symbols accessible.
<!--l. 527--><p class="indent" >   Giving a shadowing symbol to <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x188-380982r982">unintern</a></b> can uncover a name conﬂict that had
previously been resolved by the shadowing. If package A uses packages B and C,
                                                                          

                                                                          
A contains a shadowing symbol <b>x</b>, and B and C each contain external symbols
named <b>x</b>, then removing the shadowing symbol <b>x</b> from A will reveal a name
conﬂict between <b>b:x</b> and <b>c:x</b> if those two symbols are distinct. In this case
<b><a 
href="symbols.html#x188-380982r982">unintern</a></b> will signal an error.
<!--l. 535--><p class="indent" >   Aborting from a name-conﬂict error leaves the original symbol accessible.
Package functions always signal name-conﬂict errors before making any change to
the package structure. When multiple changes are to be made, however, for
example when <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x188-380391r391">export</a></b> is given a list of symbols, it is permissible for the
implementation to process each change separately, so that aborting from a name
conﬂict caused by the second symbol in the list will not unexport the ﬁrst symbol
in the list. However, aborting from a name-conﬂict error caused by <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x188-380391r391">export</a></b> of a
single symbol will not leave that symbol accessible to some packages and
inaccessible to others; with respect to each symbol processed, <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x188-380391r391">export</a></b> behaves as
if it were an atomic operation.
<!--l. 548--><p class="indent" >   Continuing from a name-conﬂict error should oﬀer the user a chance to
resolve the name conﬂict in favor of either of the candidates. The package
structure should be altered to reﬂect the resolution of the name conﬂict, via
<b><a 
href="symbols.html#x188-380849r849">shadowing-import</a></b>, <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x188-380982r982">unintern</a></b>, or <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x188-380981r981">unexport</a></b>.
<!--l. 553--><p class="indent" >   A name conﬂict in <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x188-380997r997">use-package</a></b> between a symbol directly present in the
using package and an external symbol of the used package may be resolved in
favor of the ﬁrst symbol by making it a shadowing symbol, or in favor of the
second symbol by uninterning the ﬁrst symbol from the using package.
The latter resolution is dangerous if the symbol to be uninterned is an
external symbol of the using package, since it will cease to be an external
symbol.
<!--l. 561--><p class="indent" >   A name conﬂict in <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x188-380997r997">use-package</a></b> between two external symbols inherited by
the using package from other packages may be resolved in favor of either
symbol by importing it into the using package and making it a shadowing
symbol.
<!--l. 566--><p class="indent" >   A name conﬂict in <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x188-380391r391">export</a></b> between the symbol being exported and a symbol
already present in a package that would inherit the newly exported symbol may
be resolved in favor of the exported symbol by uninterning the other
one, or in favor of the already-present symbol by making it a shadowing
symbol.
<!--l. 572--><p class="indent" >   A name conﬂict in <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x188-380391r391">export</a></b> or <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x188-380982r982">unintern</a></b> due to a package inheriting two
distinct symbols with the same name from two other packages may be resolved in
favor of either symbol by importing it into the using package and making it a
shadowing symbol, just as with <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x188-380997r997">use-package</a></b>.
                                                                          

                                                                          
<!--l. 578--><p class="indent" >   A name conﬂict in <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x188-380492r492">import</a></b> between the symbol being imported and a symbol
inherited from some other package may be resolved in favor of the symbol being
imported by making it a shadowing symbol, or in favor of the symbol already
accessible by not doing the <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x188-380492r492">import</a></b>. A name conﬂict in <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x188-380492r492">import</a></b> with a symbol
already present in the package may be resolved by uninterning that symbol, or by
not doing the <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x188-380492r492">import</a></b>.
<!--l. 586--><p class="indent" >   Good user-interface style dictates that <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x188-380997r997">use-package</a></b> and <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x188-380391r391">export</a></b>, which can
cause many name conﬂicts simultaneously, ﬁrst check for all of the name conﬂicts
before presenting any of them to the user. The user may then choose to resolve all
of them wholesale or to resolve each of them individually, the latter requiring a lot
of interaction but permitting diﬀerent conﬂicts to be resolved diﬀerent
ways.
<!--l. 594--><p class="indent" >   Implementations may oﬀer other ways of resolving name conﬂicts. For
instance, if the symbols that conﬂict are not being used as objects but only as
names for functions, it may be possible to “merge” the two symbols by putting the
function deﬁnition onto both symbols. References to either symbol for purposes of
calling a function would be equivalent. A similar merging operation can be done
for variable values and for things stored on the property list. In Lisp Machine
Lisp, for example, one can also <em>forward</em> the value, function, and property cells so
that future changes to either symbol will propagate to the other one. Some other
implementations are able to do this with value cells but not with property lists.
Only the user can know whether this way of resolving a name conﬂict is
adequate, because it will work only if the use of two non-<b><a 
href="symbols.html#x188-380378r378">eq</a></b> symbols with the
same name will not prevent the correct operation of the program. The
value of oﬀering symbol merging as a way of resolving name conﬂicts is
that it can avoid the need to throw away the whole Lisp world, correct
the package-deﬁnition forms that caused the error, and start over from
scratch.
