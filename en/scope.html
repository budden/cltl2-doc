<!--l. 11--><p class="indent" >   In describing various features of the Common Lisp language, the notions of
<em>scope</em> and <em>extent</em> are frequently useful. These notion arise when some object or
construct must be referred to from some distant part of a program. <em>Scope</em> refers to
the spatial or textual region of the program within which references may
occur. <em>Extent</em> refers to the interval of time during which references may
occur.
<!--l. 18--><p class="indent" >   As a simple example, consider this program: <div class="lisp"><tt><div class="tabbing">
(defun copy-cell (x) (cons (car x) (cdr x)))
   <br>
<!--l. 21--><p class="noindent" ></div>
</tt>
</div>
<!--l. 22--><p class="indent" >   The scope of the parameter named <b>x</b> is the body of the <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x200-396327r327">defun</a></b> form. There is
no way to refer to this parameter from any other place but within the body of the
<b><a 
href="symbols.html#x200-396327r327">defun</a></b>. Similarly, the extent of the parameter <b>x</b> (for any particular call to
<b>copy-cell</b>) is the interval from the time the function is invoked to the
time it is exited. (In the general case, the extent of a parameter may last
beyond the time of function exit, but that cannot occur in this simple
case.)
<!--l. 30--><p class="indent" >   Within Common Lisp, a referenceable entity is <em>established</em> by the execution
of some language construct, and the scope and extent of the entity are
described relative to the construct and the time (during execution of
the construct) at which the entity is established. For the purposes of
this discussion, the term “entity” refers not only to Common Lisp data
objects, such as symbols and conses, but also to variable bindings (both
ordinary and special), catchers, and <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x200-396476r476">go</a></b> targets. It is important to distinguish
between an entity and a name for the entity. In a function deﬁnition such
as

(defun foo (x y) (* x (+ y 1)))
   <br>
<!--l. 43--><p class="noindent" ></div>
</tt>
</div>
<!--l. 45--><p class="indent" >   there is a single name, <b>x</b>, used to refer to the ﬁrst parameter of the procedure
whenever it is invoked; however, a new binding is established on every invocation.
A <em>binding</em> is a particular parameter instance. The value of a reference to the
name <b>x</b> depends not only on the scope within which it occurs (the one
in the body of <b>foo</b> in the example occurs in the scope of the function
deﬁnition&#x2019;s parameters) but also on the particular binding or instance
involved. (In this case, it depends on the invocation during which the
reference is made). More complicated examples appear at the end of this
chapter.
<!--l. 57--><p class="indent" >   There are a few kinds of scope and extent that are particularly useful in
describing Common Lisp:
      <ul class="itemize1">
      <li class="itemize"><em>Lexical scope</em>. Here references to the established entity can occur only
      within certain program portions that are lexically (that is, textually)
      contained within the establishing construct. Typically the construct will
      have a part designated the <em>body</em>, and the scope of all entities established
      will be (or include) the body.
      <!--l. 68--><p class="noindent" >Example: the names of parameters to a function normally are lexically
      scoped.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize"><em>Indeﬁnite scope</em>. References may occur anywhere, in any program.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize"><em>Dynamic extent</em>.  References  may  occur  at  any  time  in  the  interval
      between establishment of the entity and the explicit disestablishment of
      the entity. As a rule, the entity is disestablished when execution of the
      establishing construct completes or is otherwise terminated. Therefore
      entities with dynamic extent obey a stack-like discipline, paralleling the
      nested executions of their establishing constructs.
      <!--l. 81--><p class="noindent" >Example: the <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x200-397020r1020">with-open-ﬁle</a></b> construct opens a connection to a ﬁle
                                                                          

                                                                          
      and creates a stream object to represent the connection. The stream
      object has indeﬁnite extent, but the connection to the open ﬁle has
      dynamic  extent:  when  control  exits  the  <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x200-397020r1020">with-open-ﬁle</a></b>  construct,
      either normally or abnormally, the stream is automatically closed.
      <!--l. 87--><p class="noindent" >Example: the binding of a “special” variable has dynamic extent.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize"><em>Indeﬁnite extent</em>. The entity continues to exist as long as the possibility
      of reference remains. (An implementation is free to destroy the entity if
      it can prove that reference to it is no longer possible. Garbage collection
      strategies implicitly employ such proofs.)
      <!--l. 95--><p class="noindent" >Example: most Common Lisp data objects have indeﬁnite extent.

<!--l. 118--><p class="indent" >   In addition to the above terms, it is convenient to deﬁne <em>dynamic scope</em> to
mean <em>indeﬁnite scope and dynamic extent</em>. Thus we speak of “special” variables as
having dynamic scope, or being dynamically scoped, because they have indeﬁnite
scope and dynamic extent: a special variable can be referred to anywhere as long
as its binding is currently in eﬀect.
<!--l. 125--><p class="indent" >   The term “dynamic scope” is a misnomer. Nevertheless it is both traditional
and useful.
<!--l. 128--><p class="indent" >   The above deﬁnitions do not take into account the possibility of <em>shadowing</em>.
Remote reference of entities is accomplished by using <em>names</em> of one kind or
another. If two entities have the same name, then the second may shadow the
ﬁrst, in which case an occurrence of the name will refer to the second and cannot
refer to the ﬁrst.
<!--l. 134--><p class="indent" >   In the case of lexical scope, if two constructs that establish entities with
the same name are textually nested, then references within the inner
construct refer to the entity established by the inner one; the inner one
shadows the outer one. Outside the inner construct but inside the outer
one, references refer to the entity established by the outer construct. For
example:
<div class="lisp">
<tt>
<!--l. 142--><p class="indent" >   <div class="tabbing">
(defun test (x z)
   <br>                                                           (let ((z (* x 2))) (print z))<br>
  z)<br>
<!--l. 146--><p class="noindent" ></div>
</tt>
</div>
<!--l. 148--><p class="indent" >   The binding of the variable <b>z</b> by the <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x200-396543r543">let</a></b> construct shadows the parameter
binding for the function <b>test</b>. The reference to the variable <b>z</b> in the <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x200-396751r751">print</a></b> form
                                                                          

                                                                          
refers to the <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x200-396543r543">let</a></b> binding. The reference to <b>z</b> at the end of the function refers to
the parameter named <b>z</b>.
<!--l. 154--><p class="indent" >   In the case of dynamic extent, if the time intervals of two entities overlap, then
one interval will necessarily be nested within the other one. This is a property of
the design of Common Lisp.
_______________________________________________<div class="implementation">
<!--l. 159--><p class="noindent" ><b>Implementation note:</b> Behind the assertion that dynamic extents nest properly is the
assumption that there is only a single program or process. Common Lisp does not
address the problems of multiprogramming (timesharing) or multiprocessing (more than
one active processor) within a single Lisp environment. The documentation for
implementations that extend Common Lisp for multiprogramming or multiprocessing
should be very clear on what modiﬁcations are induced by such extensions to the rules of
extent and scope. Implementors should note that Common Lisp has been carefully
designed to allow special variables to be implemented using either the “deep
binding” technique or the “shallow binding” technique, but the two techniques have
diﬀerent semantic and performance implications for multiprogramming and
multiprocessing.

<!--l. 178--><p class="indent" >     A reference by name to an entity with dynamic extent will always refer to the

<!--l. 326--><p class="indent" >   At the time the <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x200-396444r444">funcall</a></b> is executed there are two <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x200-396148r148">block</a></b> exit points
outstanding, each apparently named <b>here</b>. In the trace above, these exit points
                                                                          

                                                                          
are distinguished for expository purposes by subscripts. The <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x200-396818r818">return-from</a></b> form
executed as a result of the <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x200-396444r444">funcall</a></b> operation refers to the <em>outer</em> outstanding exit
point (<b>here<span class="math"><sub>1</sub></span></b>), not the inner one (<b>here<span class="math"><sub>2</sub></span></b>). This is a consequence of the rules of
lexical scoping: it refers to that exit point textually visible at the point of
execution of the <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x200-396446r446">function</a></b> construct (here abbreviated by the <b>#&#x2019;</b> syntax)
that resulted in creation of the function object actually invoked by the
<b><a 
href="symbols.html#x200-396444r444">funcall</a></b>.
<!--l. 341--><p class="indent" >   If, in this example, one were to change the form <b>(funcall f)</b> to <b>(funcall g)</b>,
then the value of the call <b>(contorted-example nil nil 2)</b> would be <b>9</b>. The value
would change because the <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x200-396444r444">funcall</a></b> would cause the execution of <b>(return-from
here<span class="math"><sub>2</sub></span>  4)</b>, thereby causing a return from the inner exit point (<b>here<span class="math"><sub>2</sub></span></b>).
When that occurs, the value <b>4</b> is returned from the middle invocation of
<b>contorted-example</b>, <b>5</b> is added to that to get <b>9</b>, and that value is returned from
the outer block and the outermost call to <b>contorted-example</b>. The point is that
the choice of exit point returned from has nothing to do with its being innermost
or outermost; rather, it depends on the lexical scoping information that is
eﬀectively packaged up with a lambda-expression when the <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x200-396446r446">function</a></b> construct is
executed.
<!--l. 356--><p class="indent" >   This function <b>contorted-example</b> works only because the function named by
<b><a 
href="symbols.html#x200-396395r395">f</a></b> is invoked during the extent of the exit point. Block exit points are like
non-special variable bindings in having lexical scope, but they diﬀer in
having dynamic extent rather than indeﬁnite extent. Once the ﬂow of
execution has left the block construct, the exit point is disestablished. For
example:
<div class="lisp">
<tt>
<!--l. 363--><p class="indent" >   <div class="tabbing">
(defun illegal-example ()
   <br>                 (let ((y (block here #&#x2019;(lambda (z) (return-from here z)))))<br>
    (if (numberp y) y (funcall y 5))))<br>
<!--l. 367--><p class="noindent" ></div>
</tt>
</div>
<!--l. 369--><p class="indent" >   One might expect the call <b>(illegal-example)</b> to produce <b>5</b> by the
following incorrect reasoning: the <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x200-396543r543">let</a></b> statement binds the variable <b>y</b> to
                                                                          

                                                                          
the value of the <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x200-396148r148">block</a></b> construct; this value is a function resulting from
the lambda-expression. Because <b>y</b> is not a number, it is invoked on the
value <b>5</b>. The <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x200-396818r818">return-from</a></b> should then return this value from the exit
point named <b>here</b>, thereby exiting from the block <em>again</em> and giving <b>y</b> the
value <b>5</b> which, being a number, is then returned as the value of the call to
<b>illegal-example</b>.
<!--l. 380--><p class="indent" >   The argument fails only because exit points are deﬁned in Common Lisp to
have dynamic extent. The argument is correct up to the execution of the
<b><a 
href="symbols.html#x200-396818r818">return-from</a></b>. The execution of the <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x200-396818r818">return-from</a></b> is an error, however, <em>not</em>
because it cannot refer to the exit point, but because it does correctly refer to an
exit point <em>and</em> that exit point has been disestablished.
