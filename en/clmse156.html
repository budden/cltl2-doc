<!--l. 26--><p class="noindent" >Often we ﬁnd it useful to describe a function in terms of its behavior in “normal
situations.” For example, we may say informally that the function <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x200-396060r60">+</a></b> returns the
sum of its arguments or that the function <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x200-396781r781">read-char</a></b> returns the next available
character on a given input stream.
<!--l. 32--><p class="indent" >   Sometimes, however, an “exceptional situation” will arise that does not ﬁt
neatly into such descriptions. For example, <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x200-396060r60">+</a></b> might receive an argument that is
not a number, or <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x200-396781r781">read-char</a></b> might receive as a single argument a stream that
has no more available characters. This distinction between normal and
exceptional situations is in some sense arbitrary but is often very useful in
practice.
<!--l. 39--><p class="indent" >   For example, suppose a function <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x200-396395r395">f</a></b> were deﬁned to allow only integer arguments
but also guaranteed to detect and signal an error for non-integer arguments. Such
a description is in fact internally inconsistent (that is, paradoxical) because the
function&#x2019;s behavior is well-deﬁned for non-integers. Yet we would not want this
annoying paradox to force description of <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x200-396395r395">f</a></b> as a function that accepts any kind of
argument (just in case <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x200-396395r395">f</a></b> is being called only as a quick way to signal an error, for
example). Using the normal/exceptional distinction, we can say clearly
that <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x200-396395r395">f</a></b> accepts integers in the normal situation and signals an error in
exceptional situations. Moreover, we can say that when we refer to the
deﬁnition of a function informally, it is acceptable to speak only of its normal
behavior. For example, we can speak informally about <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x200-396395r395">f</a></b> as a function that
accepts only integers without feeling that we are committing some awful
fraud.
<!--l. 54--><p class="indent" >   Not all exceptional situations are errors. For example, a program that is
                                                                          

                                                                          
directing the typing of a long line of text may come to an end-of-line. It is possible
that no real harm will result from failing to signal end-of-line to its caller because
the operating system will simply force a carriage return on the output device,
which will continue typing on the next line. However, it may still be interesting to
establish a protocol whereby the printing program can inform its caller
of end-of-line exceptions. The caller could then opt to deal with these
situations in interesting ways at certain times. For example, a caller might
choose to terminate printing, obtaining an end-of-line truncation. The
important thing, however, is that the failure of the caller to provide advice
about the situation need not prevent the printer program from operating
correctly.
<!--l. 67--><p class="indent" >   Mechanisms for dealing with exceptional situations vary widely. When an
exceptional situation is encountered, a program may attempt to handle it by
returning a distinguished value, returning an additional value, setting a variable,
calling a function, performing a special transfer of control, or stopping the
program altogether and entering the debugger.
<!--l. 73--><p class="indent" >   For the most part, the facilities described in this chapter do not introduce any
fundamentally new way of dealing with exceptional situations. Rather, they
encapsulate and formalize useful patterns of data and control ﬂow that have been
seen to be useful in dealing with exceptional situations.
<!--l. 78--><p class="indent" >   A proper conceptual approach to errors should perhaps begin from ﬁrst
principles, with a discussion of <em>conditions</em> in general, and eventually work up
to the concept of an <em>error</em> as just one of the many kinds of conditions.
However, given the primitive state of error-handling technology, a proper
buildup may be as inappropriate as requiring that a beggar learn to cook a
gourmet meal before being allowed to eat. Thus, we deal ﬁrst with the
essentials—error handling—and then go back later to ﬁll in the missing
details.
