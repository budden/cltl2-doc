<!--l. 23--><p class="indent" >   Common Lisp has succeeded. Since publication of the ﬁrst edition of this book
in 1984, many implementors have used it as a <em>de facto</em> standard for Lisp
implementation. As a result, it is now much easier to port large Lisp programs
from one implementation to another. Common Lisp has proved to be a useful and
stable platform for rapid prototyping and systems delivery in artiﬁcial intelligence
and other areas. With experience gained in using Common Lisp for so many
applications, implementors found no shortage of opportunities for innovation. One
of the important characteristics of Lisp is its good support for experimental
extension of the language; while Common Lisp has been stable, it has not
stagnated.
<!--l. 39--><p class="indent" >   The 1984 deﬁnition of Common Lisp was imperfect and incomplete. In some
cases this was inadvertent: some odd boundary situation was overlooked and its
consequences not speciﬁed, or diﬀerent passages were in conﬂict, or some property
of Lisp was so well-known and traditionally relied upon that I forgot to write it
down. In other cases the informal committee that was deﬁning Common
Lisp could not settle on a solution, and therefore agreed to leave some
important aspect of the language unspeciﬁed rather than choose a less than
satisfactory deﬁnition. An example is error handling; 1984 Common Lisp had
plenty of ways to signal errors but no way for a program to trap or process
them.
<!--l. 51--><p class="indent" >   Over the next year I collected reports of errors in the book and gaps in the
language. In December 1985, a group of implementors and users met in
Boston to discuss the state of Common Lisp. I prepared two lists for
this meeting, one of errata and clariﬁcations that I thought would be
relatively uncontroversial (boy, was I wrong!) and one of more substantial
changes I thought should be considered and perhaps voted upon. Others also
brought proposals to discuss. It became clear to everyone that there was
                                                                          

                                                                          
now enough interest in Common Lisp, and dependence on its stability,
that a more formal mechanism was needed for managing changes to the
language.
<!--l. 62--><p class="indent" >   This realization led to the formation of X3J13, a subcommittee of ANSI
committee X3, to produce a formal American National Standard for Common
Lisp. That process is nearing completion. X3J13 has completed the bulk of its
technical work in rectifying the 1984 deﬁnition and codifying extensions to that
deﬁnition that have received widespread use and approval. A draft standard is
now being prepared; it will probably be available in 1990. There will then be a
period (required by ANSI) for public review. X3J13 must then consider the
comments it receives and respond appropriately. If the comments result in
substantial changes to the draft standard, multiple public review periods may
be required before the draft can be approved as an American National
Standard.
<!--l. 76--><p class="indent" >   Fortunately, X3J13 has done an outstanding job of documenting its work. For
every change that came to a formal vote, a document was prepared that described
the problem to be solved and one or more solutions. For each solution there is a
detailed proposal for changing the language; a rationale; test cases that
distinguish the proposal from the status quo or from other proposals for solving
that problem; discussions of current practice, cost to implementors, cost to
users, cost of not adopting the proposal, beneﬁts of adoption, aesthetic
criteria; and any relevant informal discussion that may have preceded
creation of the formal proposal. All of these proposal documents were made
available on-line as well as in paper form. By my count, by June 1989 some
186 such proposals were approved as language changes. (This count does
not include many proposals that came before the committee but were
rejected.)
<!--l. 92--><p class="indent" >   The purpose of this second edition is to bridge the gap between the ﬁrst
edition and the forthcoming ANSI standard for Common Lisp. Because of the
requirement for formal public review, it will be some time yet before the
ANSI standard is ﬁnal. This book in no way resembles the forthcoming
standard (which is being written independently by Kathy Chapman of
Digital Equipment Corporation with assistance from the X3J13 Drafting
Subcommittee).
<!--l. 101--><p class="indent" >   I have incorporated into this second edition a great deal of material based on
the votes of X3J13, in order to give the reader a picture of where the language is
heading. My purpose here is not simply to quote the X3J13 documents
verbatim but to paraphrase them and relate them to the structure of the ﬁrst
                                                                          

                                                                          
edition. A single vote by X3J13 may be discussed in many parts of this
book, and a single passage of this book may be aﬀected by many of the
votes.
<!--l. 109--><p class="indent" >   I wish to be very clear: this book is not an oﬃcial document of X3J13, though
it is based on publicly available material produced by X3J13. In no way does this
book constitute a deﬁnitive description of the forthcoming ANSI standard. The
committee&#x2019;s decisions have been remarkably stable (it has rescinded earlier
decisions only two or three times), and I do not expect radical changes in
direction. Nevertheless, it is quite probable that the draft standard will be
substantively revised in response to editorial review or public comment. I have
therefore reported here on the actions of X3J13 not to inscribe them in stone, but
to make clear how the language of the ﬁrst edition is likely to change. I have tried
to be careful in my wording to avoid saying “the language has been changed” and
to state simply that “X3J13 voted at such-and-so time to make the following
change.”
<!--l. 127--><p class="indent" >   Until the day when an oﬃcial ANSI Common Lisp standard emerges, it is
likely that the 1984 deﬁnition of Common Lisp will continue to be used
widely. This book has been designed to be used as a reference both to
the 1984 deﬁnition and to the language as modiﬁed by the actions of
X3J13.
<!--l. 133--><p class="indent" >   It contains the entire text of the ﬁrst edition of <em>Common Lisp: The Language</em>,
with corrections and minor editorial changes; however, more than half of the
material in this edition is new. All new material is identiﬁed by solid lines in the
left margin. Dotted lines in the left margin indicate material from the ﬁrst edition
that applies to the 1984 deﬁnition but that has been modiﬁed by a vote
of X3J13. Modiﬁcations to these outmoded passages are explained by
preceding or following text (which will have a solid line in the margin). In
summary:
      <ul class="itemize1">
      <li class="itemize">To use the 1984 language deﬁnition, read all material that does not
      have a solid line in the margin.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">To use the updated language deﬁnition, read everything, but be wary
      of material with a dotted line in the margin.</li></ul>
<!--l. 153--><p class="indent" >   At the end of the book is an index of the X3J13 votes, ordered by the
committee&#x2019;s internal code names (included to ease cross-reference to the X3J13
                                                                          

                                                                          
documents, which may be useful during the public review periods). References to
this list of votes appear as numbers in angle brackets; thus “<span class="math">⟨</span>14<span class="math">⟩</span>” refers to
the vote on issue number 14, whereas “[14]” refers to reference 14 in the
bibliography.
<!--l. 161--><p class="indent" >   I have kept changes to the wording of the ﬁrst-edition material to a
minimum. Obvious spelling and typographical errors have been corrected,
and the entire text has been edited to a uniform style of spelling and
punctuation. (Note in particular that the ﬁrst edition used the spelling
“signalling” but this edition, in deference to the style decision of the X3J13
Drafting Subcommittee, uses “signaling.”) A few minor changes were made to
accommodate typographical or layout constraints. (For example, the word “also”
has been deleted from the ﬁrst sentence of chapter 1, partly to make
that paragraph look better and partly to allow a better page break at
the bottom of page 2.) In a very few cases the ﬁrst edition contained
substantive errors that I could not in good conscience correct silently; these
have been ﬂagged by paragraphs beginning with the phrase <em>Notice of
correction</em>.
<!--l. 177--><p class="indent" >   The chapter and section numbering of this edition matches that of the ﬁrst
edition, with the exception that a new section <a 
href="clmse43.html#x55-900007.9">7.9<!--tex4ht:ref: STRUCTURE-TRAVERSAL-SECTION --></a> has been interpolated. Four
new chapters (<a 
href="clmch26.html#x155-22700026">26<!--tex4ht:ref: LOOP --></a>–<a 
href="condition.html#x189-31900029">29<!--tex4ht:ref: CONDITION --></a>) describe substantial changes approved by X3J13: an
extended <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x200-396577r577">loop</a></b> macro, a pretty printer interface, the Common Lisp Object
System, and the Common Lisp Condition System.
<!--l. 186--><p class="indent" >   X3J13, in the course of its work, formed a subcommittee to study whether
additional means of iteration should be standardized for use in Common Lisp,
for a great deal of existing practice in this area was not included in the
ﬁrst edition because of lack of agreement in 1984. The X3J13 Iteration
Subcommittee produced reports on three possible facilities. One (<b><a 
href="symbols.html#x200-396577r577">loop</a></b>) was
approved for inclusion in the forthcoming draft standard and is described in
chapter <a 
href="clmch26.html#x155-22700026">26<!--tex4ht:ref: LOOP --></a>.
<!--l. 195--><p class="indent" >   X3J13 expressed interest in the other two approaches (series and generators),
but the consensus as of January 1989 was that these other approaches were not
yet suﬃciently mature or in suﬃciently widespread use to warrant inclusion in the
draft Common Lisp standard at that time. However, the subcommittee was
directed to continue work on these approaches and X3J13 is open to the
possibility of standardizing them at a later date. Please note that I do not wish
the prejudge the question of whether X3J13 will ever choose to make the other
two proposals the subject of standardization. Nevertheless, I have chosen to
include them in the second edition, in cooperation with Dr. Richard C. Waters,
                                                                          

                                                                          
as appendices ?? and ??, in order to make these ideas available to the
Lisp community. In my judgement these proposals address an area of
language design not otherwise covered by Common Lisp and are likely to
have practical value even if they are never adopted as part of a formal
standard.
<!--l. 214--><p class="indent" >   Some new material in this book has nothing to do with the work of
X3J13. In many places I have added explanations, clariﬁcations, new
examples, warnings, and tips on writing portable code. Appendix ??
contains a piece of code that may help in understanding the backquote
syntax.
<!--l. 220--><p class="indent" >   This second edition, unlike the ﬁrst edition, also includes a few diagrams to
pep up the text. However, there are absolutely no new jokes, and very few
outright lies.
